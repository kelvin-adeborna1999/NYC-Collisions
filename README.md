# NYC Collisions Analysis (Power BI)
## Project Description
This project analyzes motor vehicle collisions reported by the New York City Police Department from January 2020 to April 2023. Each record represents a single collision, including date, time, location, vehicles and victims involved, and contributing factors. The analysis aims to uncover trends, high-risk locations, and common causes of accidents.

## Dataset
Public NYC collision dataset containing details such as:

1. Date and time of the accident
2. Location (borough, zip code, street name, latitude/longitude)
3. Vehicles and victims involved
4. Contributing factors

## Data Cleaning and Modeling
1. Removed duplicate records using Collision ID
2. Standardized data types (date, time, numeric, geospatial)
3. Normalized categorical values
4. Handled missing values and created data quality flags
5. Implemented a star schema model in Power BI

## Analysis Focus
1. Monthly Trends: Percentage of total accidents by month and seasonal patterns
2. Timing of Accidents: Frequency by day of the week and hour of day
3. High-Risk Streets: Streets with the most reported accidents and their share of total accidents
4. Contributing Factors: Most common factors overall and for fatal accidents

## Tools Used
1. Power BI
2. Power Query (M)
3. DAX
4. Excel
